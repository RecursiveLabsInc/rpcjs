# RPCjs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sidekickcode/rpcjs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sidekickcode/rpcjs)

The easiest RPC you've seen, that plays well with:

- all environments: Node, Browser, Electron etc
- all transports: TPC, sockets, whatever you fancy?
- all Promise-A implemenations: Bluebird, Q, ES6, jQuery etc
- all node versions: 0.10 +, es6 or not

How? By having a cut down API.

Docs to come, for now if you're interested read the tests!
